    You can either paste a line from the <a
        href="https://github.com/BioContainers/multi-package-containers/blob/master/combinations/hash.tsv"
        >hash.tsv</a
    > file that tracks already built multi-package containers or fill in the information
    below. Pasting in content takes precedence over the filled in information.

<p>
    Once you start adding information, an image name will be generated and shown above.
    That name will also be checked on <a href="https://quay.io">Quay.io</a> to see if
    such an image exists in the
    <a href="https://quay.io/organization/biocontainers">BioContainers organization</a>.
    If the image exists, you should see a &#10004; appear after a moment, otherwise
    there will be a &#10060;.
